Compile and use Multiple Files
    How to use multiple Files
     -> Html FIle: We can use multiple .js file using script tag as shown in index.html file
    How to compile multiple Files
        -> When we make changes in all the .ts files of included .js files then we need to compile them
            1) Not a good way: Compile one by one, may be time complexing when there is large number of files
            2) Using tsconfig :
                command (to initialize config file): `tsc init`
                after that for compiling: `tsc --watch` :will automatically compile

                ** now whenever we create new .ts file it will automatically generate .js file for that
    Generate ts config Files
        `tsc init`
    Use watch mode file project
        `tsc --watch`
