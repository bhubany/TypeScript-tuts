What is duplicate identiffer issue
 -> Because we have declared two with same name  i.e var app and class app can be seen in app.js

How to resolve it
    -> export {}; : place it at the top of app.ts
What is watch
    -> When we make some changes in .ts file then we have to convert to js manually, which takes lots
    of time. To solve we run command "tsc app.ts --watch" which will detect and convert the changes to js.
Run Filewithout browser
    -> Using Node: "node app.js", we can see details in command terminal
let converstion
    -> Either we can use Var or let on app.ts, but on some browser let is not supported obtained in app.js in this scenario we have to 
    convert var to let manually in app.js
