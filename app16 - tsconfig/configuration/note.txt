Configuration file in TypeScript
    => Some time we have a very large and complex project then we have to tell that
        on which file should we pu input file and where output should generated 
        then we don't want to convert some TypeScript file to js file, we want to restrict them,
        Some time we just want to change the EcmaScript COnverter like Es-5, Es-6, ...

    How to make it
        got to command  Type: `tsc --init`
            -> To init config file, will create new tsconfig.json file with multiple settings inside it

    What we can config
    Try out with some Configuration

***    to run type commadnd: `tsc` on root directory ***

    Different Configurations: 

        target: what Ecma script conversion should we use, by default it is latest present
        module: 

        // can add custom configuration at the end of provided configuration
        {
            {
                .....
            },
            my Configuration
        }

        "include":["src"] => will convert into js file only for files present inside src
